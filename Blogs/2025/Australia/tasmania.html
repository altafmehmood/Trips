                        <p>Flying into Tasmania from Melbourne on Qantas flight QF1293 felt like entering another world. The quick 54-minute flight on the modern Airbus A220-200 offered stunning aerial views as we descended into Hobart. Security at Melbourne Airport was efficient as always, and we landed in Hobart ready for Tasmania's wilderness adventures.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Mount Wellington - Summit Views Over Hobart</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>We immediately drove from Hobart Airport to <a href="https://www.wellingtonpark.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Mount Wellington (kunanyi)</a>, which towers 1,271 meters above Hobart. The winding 21-kilometer drive from sea level to the summit takes you through multiple climate zones - from temperate eucalyptus forests to sub-alpine vegetation and finally to the rocky, windswept summit.</p>

                        <p>The panoramic views from the Pinnacle Observation Shelter were absolutely spectacular. Hobart sprawled below us, the Derwent River snaking through the landscape, and on the clearest days you can see all the way to Bruny Island. The mountain's dolerite columns, formed by ancient volcanic activity, create dramatic rock formations at the summit. The temperature dropped significantly as we ascended, a stark reminder of Tasmania's changeable weather - layers are essential!</p>

                        <p>Mount Wellington holds deep cultural significance for the Muwinina people, who call it kunanyi. The mountain has been a landmark for navigation, a source of fresh water, and a spiritual site for thousands of years.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After Mount Wellington, we drove to <a href="https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/towns-regions/south/hobart/opossum-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Opossum Bay</a>, a peaceful coastal suburb southeast of Hobart. This quiet seaside spot offered beautiful views across the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and a chance to relax after our mountain adventure.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Evening in Hobart - Waterfront Dining</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>We checked into the <a href="https://www.grandchancellorhotels.com/hotel-grand-chancellor-hobart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Hotel Grand Chancellor Hobart</a>, perfectly located on the waterfront with stunning views across the harbor. The hotel's central location made it easy to explore Hobart's attractions on foot.</p>

                        <p>For dinner, we walked to <a href="https://www.mures.com.au/upper-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Mures Upper Deck</a>, one of Hobart's premier seafood restaurants right on the waterfront. The restaurant specializes in fresh Tasmanian seafood, and we enjoyed a delicious meal while watching the sunset paint the sky in brilliant colors over the harbor.</p>

                        <p>Our journey from Hobart to Strahan took us through some of Tasmania's most spectacular national parks and wilderness areas. This epic drive west across the island showcases the diversity of Tasmania's landscapes - from mountain rainforests and glacial lakes to ancient temperate rainforest and wild rivers.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="day6-map" style="height: 400px; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: var(--radius-lg); overflow: hidden; box-shadow: var(--shadow-lg);"></div>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Mount Field National Park - Russell Falls & Tall Trees</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Our first stop was <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/mount-field-national-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Mount Field National Park</a>, Tasmania's oldest national park established in 1916. The park protects an extraordinary range of habitats from eucalyptus forests at lower elevations to alpine moorland on the plateau, with some of the most accessible and beautiful waterfalls in Tasmania.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/mount-field-national-park/russell-falls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Russell Falls Track</a> is an easy 20-minute walk through enchanting temperate rainforest to the park's most famous feature. Russell Falls cascades in three tiers over moss-covered rocks, surrounded by massive tree ferns that create a prehistoric atmosphere. The falls are particularly impressive after rain, though we were fortunate to see them flowing well even in summer.</p>

                        <p>The rainforest here is magnificent - dominated by massive swamp gums (the world's tallest flowering plant), myrtle beech draped in moss and lichen, and towering tree ferns creating a lush canopy overhead. The well-maintained boardwalk allows you to experience this ancient forest without impacting the delicate ecosystem.</p>

                        <p>We continued on the <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/mount-field-national-park/tall-trees-walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Tall Trees Walk</a>, a circuit track through some of the most impressive old-growth forest in Tasmania. These enormous swamp gums tower over 80 meters high, their straight trunks soaring up to a distant canopy. Walking among these giants - some hundreds of years old - gives you a profound sense of the timescales of nature.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The drive from Mount Field to Lake St Clair takes you through the beautiful Central Highlands, a region of rolling hills, pastoral farmland, and remnant forests. The small town of Ouse marks the midpoint of this scenic journey, where the landscape transitions from the lowland forests to the glacial highlands beyond.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Continuing west, we arrived at <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/lake-st-clair-national-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Lake St Clair</a>, the deepest freshwater lake in Australia at over 200 meters deep. The lake was carved by glaciers during the ice ages and sits at the southern end of the famous Overland Track, one of Australia's premier multi-day hiking routes.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/lake-st-clair-national-park/cynthia-bay-foreshore-walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Cynthia Bay Foreshore Walk</a> is a gentle track along the lake's edge, offering stunning views across the pristine glacial waters to the mountains beyond. The water is incredibly clear but freezing cold - fed by mountain streams and retaining its glacial chill year-round. On calm days, the lake's surface perfectly mirrors the surrounding peaks and ancient forests.</p>

                        <p>The area has a profound sense of wilderness and solitude. The silence is broken only by the calls of black currawongs and the gentle lapping of water on the rocky shore. It's easy to understand why this area is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area - it feels utterly untouched by human development.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p><a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park</a> protects some of the last untamed rivers in the world and was the site of one of Australia's most significant environmental campaigns in the 1980s. The successful campaign to prevent the damming of the Franklin River helped establish Tasmania's wilderness areas as World Heritage listed.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park/nelson-falls-nature-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Nelson Falls</a> walk is a short 20-minute loop through primeval rainforest to a beautiful waterfall. The forest here is even more ancient and untouched than Mount Field - massive myrtle beech trees hundreds of years old, their trunks cloaked in thick moss and epiphytic ferns. The falls themselves drop in a silvery curtain through the green gloom of the rainforest.</p>

                        <p>At <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park/donaghys-hill-wilderness-lookout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Donaghys Hill Lookout</a>, we stopped for sweeping views across the wild rivers region. From this elevated viewpoint, the landscape stretches to the horizon - endless forested mountains, deep valleys carved by ancient rivers, and not a single sign of human presence. It's a landscape that has remained essentially unchanged for millions of years.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park/franklin-river-nature-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Franklin River Nature Trail</a> descends to the edge of the wild Franklin River itself. This relatively short walk (30 minutes return) takes you down through Huon pine forest to the river's edge. Standing beside these dark, tannin-stained waters, you're touching a piece of living history - the Franklin River has been flowing through these ancient forests since before humans walked the earth.</p>

                        <p>The Huon pines along the trail are particularly special - this endemic Tasmanian tree is one of the longest-living organisms on earth, with some trees over 2,000 years old. They grow incredibly slowly in these wet, cool conditions, their timber so dense and resinous that fallen logs can remain intact for thousands of years.</p>

                        <p>After our wilderness explorations, we stopped in the historic mining town of Queenstown for dinner at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mimsokitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Mimso Kitchen</a>, a local favorite serving fresh Tasmanian cuisine with Asian influences. The seafood here is exceptional - caught fresh from the surrounding waters and prepared with creative flair.</p>

                        <p>We then continued our drive to <a href="https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/towns-regions/west-coast/strahan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Strahan</a>, nestled on the shores of massive Macquarie Harbour on Tasmania's wild west coast. This charming fishing village is the gateway to the Gordon River and Sarah Island's convict history.</p>

                        <p>We checked into <a href="https://www.strahanvillage.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Strahan Village</a>, perfectly located on the waterfront. The village-style accommodation offers comfortable rooms with views over the harbor, and the property includes excellent dining options and a cozy atmosphere that perfectly complements Strahan's laid-back charm.</p>

                        <p>Our day began in Strahan with a once-in-a-lifetime experience cruising through one of the world's last great wilderness areas, followed by our journey to Tasmania's most iconic mountain landscape.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Gordon River Cruise - Into the Wilderness</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The <a href="https://www.gordonrivercruises.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Gordon River Cruise</a> is one of Tasmania's most spectacular experiences. Departing from Strahan's waterfront, the cruise takes you across Macquarie Harbour - one of Australia's largest natural harbors, six times the size of Sydney Harbour - and deep into the heart of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.</p>

                        <p>As we crossed Macquarie Harbour toward the open ocean, we passed <strong>Bonnet Island</strong> with its distinctive lighthouse. Built in 1889, the Bonnet Island Lighthouse marks the treacherous entrance to Macquarie Harbour known as Hells Gates - a narrow 120-meter wide channel where the Southern Ocean surges through with tremendous force. The lighthouse has guided countless ships safely through these perilous waters, warning mariners of the dangerous rocks and fierce currents that have claimed many vessels over the centuries. Standing sentinel on this remote island, the lighthouse represents both the danger and the vital navigation aids that made safe passage possible in this wild corner of Tasmania.</p>

                        <p>The journey up the Gordon River is otherworldly. The river flows dark and still, stained a tea-brown color by tannins from the surrounding buttongrass plains and ancient forests. This pristine water is so pure and acidic that it preserves fallen Huon pine logs for thousands of years on the river bottom. The forest-clad hills rise steeply from the water's edge, creating a sense of complete wilderness isolation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--secondary); margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">Sarah Island - Harsh Convict History</h4>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The cruise includes a stop at <strong>Sarah Island</strong>, a former penal settlement that was once considered the harshest convict station in the British Empire. Between 1822 and 1833, convicts endured brutal conditions here, logging Huon pine in freezing conditions while chained together. Many attempted escape, though few succeeded in crossing the treacherous Southern Ocean beyond.</p>

                        <p>Walking through the sparse ruins, you can feel the weight of history. The island's isolation in the middle of massive Macquarie Harbour made it the perfect prison - escape was nearly impossible. The convicts built ships here from the prized Huon pine, ironically crafting the very vessels that would eventually transport them to other destinations. The island's history is haunting, yet the natural beauty surrounding it is undeniable.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--secondary); margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">Heritage Landing - Ancient Rainforest</h4>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The highlight of the cruise is <strong>Heritage Landing</strong>, where we disembarked to walk through one of the last remaining stands of ancient Huon pines and massive myrtle beech trees. This 2,000-year-old rainforest is utterly primeval - trees that were already ancient when the Romans walked the Earth still stand here, their trunks draped in moss and lichen.</p>

                        <p>The boardwalk winds through the forest, protecting the fragile ecosystem while allowing close encounters with these magnificent trees. Huon pines are endemic to Tasmania and among the oldest living organisms on Earth - they grow incredibly slowly, with some trees over 3,000 years old. The timber is so dense and resinous that fallen logs can remain intact on the riverbed for millennia.</p>

                        <p>The silence of this rainforest, broken only by bird calls and the gentle sound of water, is almost spiritual. Standing among these ancient giants gives you a profound sense of the timescales of nature and the importance of preserving these last wilderness areas.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After the cruise, we drove from Strahan to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/cradle-mountain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park</a>. The drive takes you through changing landscapes - from the barren, moonscape-like hills around Queenstown (stripped bare by 19th-century mining operations) to the pristine wilderness of the national park.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Arriving at Cradle Mountain in the late afternoon, we first checked into <a href="https://www.cradlemountainlodge.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Cradle Mountain Lodge</a>, a beautiful wilderness retreat nestled at the edge of the national park. The lodge offers comfortable accommodation with stunning mountain views, perfectly positioned for exploring the park.</p>

                        <p>After settling in, we drove to Ronny Creek for an evening wildlife walk. One of the advantages of visiting after 6:30pm is that you can drive your own vehicle all the way into the park without needing to take the shuttle bus - the park opens up private vehicle access outside peak hours. This made it easy to reach the best wildlife viewing spots in the evening light.</p>

                        <p>The late afternoon and early evening hours are prime time for spotting Tasmania's unique marsupials, and we weren't disappointed. Wombats were everywhere - these stocky, powerful diggers were grazing peacefully in the button grass plains, completely unfazed by our presence. We watched them waddle about on their surprisingly short legs, munching grass and occasionally marking their territory. Wombats can weigh up to 35 kilograms and are incredibly strong, using their powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems.</p>

                        <p>We also spotted several Bennett's wallabies bounding across the moorland with their distinctive hopping gait, and heard the calls of countless bird species including the beautiful pink robin and the endemic Tasmanian native-hen. The alpine landscape at dusk, with wildlife moving freely through the pristine wilderness, felt utterly magical.</p>

                        <p>As the sun began to set, Cradle Mountain's iconic jagged peak glowed in the golden light, promising spectacular hiking for the following day.</p>

Arriving at the park entrance before 7:30am allowed us to drive our own vehicle straight to the Dove Lake parking lot without needing to take the shuttle bus - a significant advantage for an early start.

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/cradle-mountain/dove-lake-circuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Dove Lake Circuit</a> is Tasmania's most famous walk, and for good reason. The iconic jagged peak of Cradle Mountain, rising 1,545 meters, reflected perfectly in Dove Lake's mirror-like surface in the calm morning conditions, creating one of those postcard-perfect scenes that no camera can truly capture. The distinctive serrated profile of the mountain dominates the landscape, formed by millions of years of glacial action that carved these dramatic dolerite peaks.</p>

                        <p>This 6-kilometer loop track showcases the best of Cradle Mountain's alpine environment. The well-maintained trail takes 2-3 hours and can be walked in either direction. We chose to walk clockwise, saving the most dramatic mountain views for the second half of the circuit.</p>

                        <p>The walk took us through remarkably diverse terrain - from beach pebbles along the shoreline where we could touch the crystal-clear glacial waters, across sturdy boardwalks through button grass plains that glow golden in the right light, and finally through ancient myrtle beech forests draped in moss and lichen. Each section offered a completely different perspective on this extraordinary landscape.</p>

                        <p>The weather at Cradle Mountain is famously changeable - it's said you can experience four seasons in one day. We were fortunate with mostly clear skies in the morning, perfect conditions for this spectacular walk.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After completing the Dove Lake Circuit, we drove to Ronny Creek parking lot to tackle another spectacular walk. The trail to Cradle Lake Lookout follows part of the famous Overland Track, Tasmania's premier multi-day hiking route that traverses 65 kilometers through the heart of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.</p>

                        <p>This shorter walk offers a taste of the Overland Track's alpine beauty without the multi-day commitment. The trail climbs steadily through button grass moorland and ancient forest, offering increasingly spectacular views back towards Cradle Mountain. The lookout provides stunning vistas over Cradle Lake, a pristine glacial tarn nestled in the mountain valley below.</p>

                        <p>The morning's exertion was rewarded with the peaceful solitude of the alpine environment and the sense of being deep in wilderness, surrounded by mountains that have stood unchanged for millennia.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After our morning hikes, we visited <a href="https://www.devils.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Devils@Cradle</a>, a wildlife sanctuary dedicated to conserving the endangered Tasmanian devil. This conservation park plays a crucial role in protecting Tasmania's iconic marsupial carnivore from the devastating facial tumor disease that has decimated wild populations.</p>

                        <p>We arrived in time for the feeding session, where we watched both Tasmanian devils and spotted-tail quolls being fed. Seeing these remarkable animals up close was unforgettable - devils are much larger and more powerful than many people expect, with incredibly strong jaws capable of crushing bones. Their fierce reputation is well-earned, though the sanctuary keepers explained their complex social behaviors and the conservation challenges they face.</p>

                        <p>Spotted-tail quolls, Australia's largest carnivorous marsupial after the Tasmanian devil, were equally impressive. These beautiful spotted animals are agile climbers and fierce predators despite their cat-like appearance. Watching them feed demonstrated their powerful hunting abilities.</p>

                        <p>The visit provided not just an opportunity to see these endangered species, but also to learn about the critical conservation work being done to ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After our morning of hiking and wildlife encounters, we faced a challenging 4-hour drive from Cradle Mountain to Freycinet Peninsula on Tasmania's east coast. This cross-country journey takes you through the heart of Tasmania, from the rugged west coast wilderness to the pristine beaches of the Tasman Sea.</p>

                        <p>The route is spectacular but demanding - winding mountain roads with countless hairpin turns, steep descents, and dramatic elevation changes. The road snakes through dense forests, past highland lakes, and over mountain passes, requiring constant attention and careful driving. While challenging, the ever-changing scenery makes every turn worthwhile.</p>

                        <p>As we descended toward the east coast, the landscape transformed from alpine wilderness to coastal forests and finally to the distinctive pink granite formations of Freycinet. The late afternoon light was perfect as we arrived at our destination.</p>

The eco-friendly lodge offers comfortable accommodation with stunning views of the surrounding bush and Great Oyster Bay. After the long drive, arriving at this peaceful coastal retreat felt like entering paradise.</p>

                        <p>The evening light over Coles Bay was magical, with the pink granite Hazards mountains glowing in the setting sun. We explored the lodge grounds and walked down to the nearby beach, enjoying the serenity after our adventurous day.</p>

                        <p>The hike to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/wineglass-bay-lookout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Wineglass Bay Lookout</a> is deservedly famous, ranking among Australia's most rewarding short walks. The well-maintained track climbs steadily for about 45 minutes through coastal forest, with stone steps helping navigate the steeper sections. We encountered pademelons (small wallabies) along the forested trail, and the distinctive calls of yellow wattlebirds echoed through the trees.</p>

                        <p>After the steady climb of around 300 meters elevation gain, the viewpoint revealed one of the world's most beautiful beaches - a perfect crescent of white sand embraced by turquoise waters and framed by the pink granite Hazards mountains. The water's brilliant aquamarine color seemed almost unreal in its intensity. Wineglass Bay consistently appears in lists of the world's top beaches, and standing at the lookout, it's easy to understand why - the combination of the perfect curve, pristine white sand, and impossibly blue water, all framed by pink granite peaks, creates a scene of such natural beauty that it feels almost too perfect to be real.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Sleepy Bay Beach</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After Wineglass Bay, we drove a short distance to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/sleepy-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Sleepy Bay</a>, a hidden gem that many visitors overlook in favor of the more famous Wineglass Bay. The short 15-minute walk through coastal heathland leads to a secluded beach nestled between massive pink granite boulders.</p>

                        <p>Sleepy Bay is utterly spectacular - enormous orange-pink granite boulders, some the size of houses, frame a small but perfect beach. The rocks glow in the morning light, their distinctive color created by iron-rich feldspar minerals. The contrast between the warm-toned granite, white sand, and brilliant turquoise water creates one of Tasmania's most photogenic coastal scenes. Unlike the sweeping curve of Wineglass Bay, Sleepy Bay feels intimate and sheltered, almost like a secret cove.</p>

                        <p>We spent time exploring the rocky shoreline, photographing the play of light on the granite, and simply enjoying the peaceful beauty of this special place. The bay is perfectly sheltered from the wind, living up to its peaceful name.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Our final stop in Freycinet was <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/cape-tourville" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Cape Tourville</a>, home to an automated lighthouse perched on dramatic coastal cliffs. The 20-minute wheelchair-accessible circuit walk around the headland offers spectacular 360-degree views of the Freycinet Peninsula, the Hazards mountains, and the Tasman Sea stretching to the horizon.</p>

                        <p>The coastal scenery from Cape Tourville is breathtaking - waves crash against pink granite cliffs far below, while the turquoise and deep blue waters of the Tasman Sea create a stunning color palette. On a clear day like ours, you can see for miles along the coastline in both directions. The lighthouse itself, built in 1971, is a striking white tower that has guided ships safely along this spectacular but treacherous coastline for over 50 years.</p>

                        <p>Standing on the exposed headland with the wind whipping around us, surrounded by that incredible blue ocean and pink granite, we felt privileged to experience such natural beauty. From here, we could see the sweep of Friendly Beaches to the north - our next and final stop in Freycinet National Park.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After Cape Tourville, we drove north to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/friendly-beaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Friendly Beaches</a>, a stunning stretch of pristine white sand beach on the northern edge of Freycinet National Park. True to its name, this expansive beach felt welcoming and peaceful, with gentle waves rolling onto the shore.</p>

                        <p>Friendly Beaches is a 3-kilometer sweep of white sand backed by coastal dunes and native vegetation. Unlike the dramatic granite scenery of Wineglass Bay and Sleepy Bay, Friendly Beaches offers a different kind of beauty - wide open spaces, endless sand, and the feeling of having a pristine beach almost entirely to yourself. The beach faces northeast, making it a perfect spot for sunrise, and the shallow gradient of the sand creates beautiful patterns in the water.</p>

                        <p>We walked along the beach, enjoying the solitude and the sound of waves. The beach is a popular spot for surfing when conditions are right, and the northern end offers access to scenic coastal walks. It was the perfect final beach stop before our drive back to Hobart.</p>

                        <p>After our morning exploring Freycinet's coastal highlights, we began the 2.5-hour drive back to Hobart for our evening flight to Sydney. The drive retraced our route south through Tasmania's scenic east coast, passing through small coastal towns and offering final glimpses of the island's beautiful landscapes.</p>

                        <p>Our 9 days in Tasmania had taken us from the sophisticated capital of Hobart to wilderness areas like Mount Field and Franklin-Gordon, from the wild west coast at Strahan to the alpine beauty of Cradle Mountain, and finally to the stunning coastal paradise of Freycinet. Tasmania exceeded all our expectations with its pristine wilderness, unique wildlife, and breathtaking natural beauty at every turn.</p>

Friendly Beaches provides a completely different experience - 3km of pristine white sand perfect for a peaceful beach walk before leaving the park.
