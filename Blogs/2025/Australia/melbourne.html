                        <p>After two incredible days exploring Sydney's harbour and beaches, we boarded Qantas flight QF419 for the short 90-minute journey to Melbourne. The smooth flight featured complimentary snacks and drinks, and before we knew it, we were descending into Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport.</p>

                        <p>At Melbourne Airport, we picked up our rental car - essential for exploring the Great Ocean Road at our own pace. With the freedom of four wheels, we immediately headed south toward the coast, eager to experience Victoria's legendary coastal scenery. The anticipation built as we drove through Melbourne's suburbs and out toward the sea.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Our first stop was the scenic coastal area near Melbourne, where we took in the Millionaire Walk - a beautiful coastal path that gave us our first taste of Victoria's stunning shoreline. The walk offered spectacular views of the rugged coastline, with waves crashing against rocky outcrops and seabirds wheeling overhead.</p>

                        <p>This initial coastal experience set the tone for what would be an extraordinary two days of coastal exploration. The afternoon light caught the ocean spray, creating a golden glow over the water as we walked along the clifftop paths. It was a gentle introduction to the dramatic coastal landscapes that awaited us on the Great Ocean Road.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">The Great Ocean Road - Australia's Most Scenic Drive</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The next morning, we set out early to tackle the <a href="https://www.visitvictoria.com/regions/great-ocean-road" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Great Ocean Road</a> - one of the world's most spectacular coastal drives. Stretching 243 kilometers along Victoria's southeastern coast, this iconic route was built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932, and stands as both an engineering marvel and a memorial to those who served in World War I.</p>

                        <p>The drive hugs the coastline, winding through lush rainforests, past pristine beaches, and alongside towering limestone cliffs. Each bend in the road revealed new vistas - azure waters stretching to the horizon, dramatic rock formations sculpted by millennia of wind and waves, and charming coastal towns nestled in protected bays.</p>

                        <p>What makes the Great Ocean Road truly special is its variety. In a single day's drive, you experience diverse landscapes: the surf beaches of Torquay, the towering trees of the Otway Ranges, the windswept cliffs of Port Campbell, and the peaceful fishing villages that dot the coast. It's a journey through some of Australia's most pristine coastal wilderness.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <strong>Drive Tip:</strong> Start early in the morning to avoid crowds at the Twelve Apostles. The drive from Melbourne to Port Campbell takes about 3-4 hours, but allow a full day to stop at lookouts and explore coastal towns along the way.

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Anglesea - Surf Beach Serenity</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Our first major stop was Anglesea, a laid-back surf town that perfectly captures the essence of coastal Victoria. The beach here is wide and golden, backed by sand dunes and native vegetation. Early morning surfers were already out catching waves, while locals walked their dogs along the shoreline.</p>

                        <p>We strolled along the beach, feeling the cool morning sand between our toes and breathing in the fresh ocean air. Anglesea has a wonderfully relaxed vibe - it's the kind of place where people come to escape the city and reconnect with the simple pleasures of beach life. The combination of reliable surf, pristine beaches, and a friendly small-town atmosphere makes it a favorite among Melbourne locals.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Aireys Inlet & Split Point Lighthouse</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Just a short drive from Anglesea, we arrived at Aireys Inlet, home to the iconic Split Point Lighthouse. Perched dramatically on clifftops above the Southern Ocean, this striking white lighthouse has been guiding ships since 1891. Affectionately known as the "White Queen," the lighthouse stands 34 meters tall and offers panoramic views of the rugged coastline.</p>

                        <p>The clifftop location is spectacular - you can see for miles along the coast in both directions, with waves crashing against the rocks far below. The lighthouse grounds provide multiple vantage points, each offering a different perspective on the dramatic coastal scenery. The combination of the pristine white tower against the deep blue ocean and golden cliffs creates one of the Great Ocean Road's most photographed scenes.</p>

                        <p>Walking around the lighthouse area, we discovered several clifftop walking trails that wind through native coastal vegetation. The views from these paths are extraordinary - endless ocean meeting dramatic cliffs, with the lighthouse standing proud as a beacon of maritime history.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Lorne - The Jewel of the Coast</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Continuing along the Great Ocean Road, we arrived at Lorne - often called the jewel of Victoria's coast. This vibrant beach town sits in a natural amphitheater, with the Otway Ranges rising steeply behind and a beautiful crescent beach curving along the bay in front. Lorne manages to be both sophisticated and laid-back, with excellent cafes and restaurants lining the main street, yet maintaining that quintessential Australian beach town charm.</p>

                        <p>The beach itself is stunning - soft golden sand framed by Norfolk pines, with crystal-clear turquoise waters that seemed almost tropical in the afternoon light. We walked along the foreshore, watching surfers ride the gentle waves and families enjoying picnics under the pines. The Erskine River flows through the town and meets the ocean at the beach, adding to the area's natural beauty.</p>

                        <p>Lorne has long been a favorite escape for Melbourne residents, and it's easy to see why. The combination of beautiful beaches, lush hinterland, excellent dining, and proximity to waterfalls and rainforest walks makes it one of the Great Ocean Road's most complete destinations.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Port Campbell National Park - The Twelve Apostles & Limestone Coast</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The highlight of any Great Ocean Road journey is Port Campbell National Park, home to some of Australia's most dramatic coastal scenery. This stretch of coastline features towering limestone cliffs, natural arches, and massive rock stacks that rise from the Southern Ocean like ancient sentinels.</p>

                        <p>The limestone formations here are the result of millions of years of erosion. Originally part of the mainland cliffs, these structures have been gradually separated by the relentless pounding of the Southern Ocean's waves. The soft limestone is continuously being sculpted by wind and water, meaning the landscape is ever-changing - what we see today will look different in a hundred years, and some formations will eventually collapse back into the sea.</p>

                        <p>The Twelve Apostles are undoubtedly the most famous of these formations. Despite the name, there were never twelve stacks - currently, only eight remain standing. These massive limestone pillars rise up to 45 meters from the ocean, creating one of Australia's most iconic and photographed landscapes. We visited at different times of day, watching how the changing light transformed the scene - the golden limestone glowing at sunrise, dramatic shadows at midday, and warm amber tones at sunset.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <strong>Photography Tip:</strong> Visit the Twelve Apostles at sunrise for the best light and smallest crowds. The golden morning light illuminates the formations beautifully, and you might have the viewing platforms nearly to yourself.

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Loch Ard Gorge - A Hidden Natural Wonder</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Just a few minutes' drive from the Twelve Apostles, we discovered what many consider the Great Ocean Road's hidden gem - Loch Ard Gorge. This dramatic natural formation is named after the clipper ship Loch Ard, which tragically wrecked on nearby Muttonbird Island in 1878. Of the 54 people aboard, only two survived - 19-year-old ship's apprentice Tom Pearce and 17-year-old passenger Eva Carmichael - who were washed into this sheltered gorge.</p>

                        <p>The gorge itself is a stunning natural amphitheater carved into the limestone cliffs. A stairway descends through a narrow ravine to a small, pristine beach surrounded by towering 70-meter cliffs. The turquoise water is remarkably calm here, protected from the ocean's fury by the encircling cliffs. It's like stepping into a hidden world - the dramatic scale of the cliffs, the golden sand, and the crystal-clear water create a scene that feels almost otherworldly.</p>

                        <p>We explored the various viewing platforms that offer different perspectives on the gorge - some looking down from the clifftops, others at beach level looking up at the towering walls. The contrast between the sheltered tranquility of the gorge and the wild ocean just beyond the cliffs is striking. Standing on the small beach, looking up at the massive limestone walls, it's easy to imagine the terror and relief the shipwreck survivors must have felt being washed into this natural sanctuary.</p>
                    </div>
