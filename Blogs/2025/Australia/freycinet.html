                        <p>Our final full day in Tasmania was dedicated to exploring <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Freycinet National Park</a>, one of Tasmania's most iconic coastal destinations. We woke early at Freycinet Lodge to maximize our time exploring the park's stunning coastline and beaches before our evening flight back to Sydney.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Wineglass Bay Lookout</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>The hike to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/wineglass-bay-lookout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Wineglass Bay Lookout</a> is deservedly famous, ranking among Australia's most rewarding short walks. The well-maintained track climbs steadily for about 45 minutes through coastal forest, with stone steps helping navigate the steeper sections. We encountered pademelons (small wallabies) along the forested trail, and the distinctive calls of yellow wattlebirds echoed through the trees.</p>

                        <p>After the steady climb of around 300 meters elevation gain, the viewpoint revealed one of the world's most beautiful beaches - a perfect crescent of white sand embraced by turquoise waters and framed by the pink granite Hazards mountains. The water's brilliant aquamarine color seemed almost unreal in its intensity. Wineglass Bay consistently appears in lists of the world's top beaches, and standing at the lookout, it's easy to understand why - the combination of the perfect curve, pristine white sand, and impossibly blue water, all framed by pink granite peaks, creates a scene of such natural beauty that it feels almost too perfect to be real.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Sleepy Bay Beach</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After Wineglass Bay, we drove a short distance to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/sleepy-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Sleepy Bay</a>, a hidden gem that many visitors overlook in favor of the more famous Wineglass Bay. The short 15-minute walk through coastal heathland leads to a secluded beach nestled between massive pink granite boulders.</p>

                        <p>Sleepy Bay is utterly spectacular - enormous orange-pink granite boulders, some the size of houses, frame a small but perfect beach. The rocks glow in the morning light, their distinctive color created by iron-rich feldspar minerals. The contrast between the warm-toned granite, white sand, and brilliant turquoise water creates one of Tasmania's most photogenic coastal scenes. Unlike the sweeping curve of Wineglass Bay, Sleepy Bay feels intimate and sheltered, almost like a secret cove.</p>

                        <p>We spent time exploring the rocky shoreline, photographing the play of light on the granite, and simply enjoying the peaceful beauty of this special place. The bay is perfectly sheltered from the wind, living up to its peaceful name.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Cape Tourville Lighthouse</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Our final stop in Freycinet was <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/cape-tourville" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Cape Tourville</a>, home to an automated lighthouse perched on dramatic coastal cliffs. The 20-minute wheelchair-accessible circuit walk around the headland offers spectacular 360-degree views of the Freycinet Peninsula, the Hazards mountains, and the Tasman Sea stretching to the horizon.</p>

                        <p>The coastal scenery from Cape Tourville is breathtaking - waves crash against pink granite cliffs far below, while the turquoise and deep blue waters of the Tasman Sea create a stunning color palette. On a clear day like ours, you can see for miles along the coastline in both directions. The lighthouse itself, built in 1971, is a striking white tower that has guided ships safely along this spectacular but treacherous coastline for over 50 years.</p>

                        <p>Standing on the exposed headland with the wind whipping around us, surrounded by that incredible blue ocean and pink granite, we felt privileged to experience such natural beauty. From here, we could see the sweep of Friendly Beaches to the north - our next and final stop in Freycinet National Park.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Friendly Beaches</h3>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After Cape Tourville, we drove north to <a href="https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park/friendly-beaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;">Friendly Beaches</a>, a stunning stretch of pristine white sand beach on the northern edge of Freycinet National Park. True to its name, this expansive beach felt welcoming and peaceful, with gentle waves rolling onto the shore.</p>

                        <p>Friendly Beaches is a 3-kilometer sweep of white sand backed by coastal dunes and native vegetation. Unlike the dramatic granite scenery of Wineglass Bay and Sleepy Bay, Friendly Beaches offers a different kind of beauty - wide open spaces, endless sand, and the feeling of having a pristine beach almost entirely to yourself. The beach faces northeast, making it a perfect spot for sunrise, and the shallow gradient of the sand creates beautiful patterns in the water.</p>

                        <p>We walked along the beach, enjoying the solitude and the sound of waves. The beach is a popular spot for surfing when conditions are right, and the northern end offers access to scenic coastal walks. It was the perfect final beach stop before our drive back to Hobart.</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>After our morning exploring Freycinet's coastal highlights, we began the 2.5-hour drive back to Hobart for our evening flight to Sydney. The drive retraced our route south through Tasmania's scenic east coast, passing through small coastal towns and offering final glimpses of the island's beautiful landscapes.</p>

                        <p>Our 9 days in Tasmania had taken us from the sophisticated capital of Hobart to wilderness areas like Mount Field and Franklin-Gordon, from the wild west coast at Strahan to the alpine beauty of Cradle Mountain, and finally to the stunning coastal paradise of Freycinet. Tasmania exceeded all our expectations with its pristine wilderness, unique wildlife, and breathtaking natural beauty at every turn.</p>

Friendly Beaches provides a completely different experience - 3km of pristine white sand perfect for a peaceful beach walk before leaving the park.
